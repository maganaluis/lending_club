# Lending Club Classification

School Project Version of Classification models on the Lending Club Dataset. In this project I used Logistic Regression, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (Vanilla Neural Network) and a Gradient Boosting Classifier (xgboost). The last model was able to perform better than 95% percent of all models in the class.
